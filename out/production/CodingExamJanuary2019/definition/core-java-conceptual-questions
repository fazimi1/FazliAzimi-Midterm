What is IDE?
A.
Integrated Development environment
What are the IDEs available in the market to support java?

Explain the entire java life cycle.
Input Unit recieves data from the input devices such as the keyboard, mouse and any other peripherals

Memory Unit the primary memory unit (Random Access Memory(RAM)) provides fast access storage of computer programs, data from the input devices and data to be sent to the output devices.

Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU) peforms the arithmetic calculations on data in memory, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and comparison.

Central Processing Unit (CPU) manages the other units by sending messages to the input unit to read data into the memory unit, informs the ALU which data to operate on, etc.

Storage Unit stores and reads data and programs in long-term storage (e.g. harddisk drive) to be used at a later time.

Output Unit sends information from the computer to make it available outside of the computer, e.g. printer, network device etc.
what is class? A blueprint or template for creating objects.
What is object? An instance of a class.
What is the entry point of an application? The main method.
Why main is static? It is the entry point for the JVM(Java Virtual Machine) into the java program therefor static methods and variables can be directly accessed with the help of Class,
which means that there is no need to create objects in order to access static methods or variables.
Which class is the superclass of all classes? Object class
What is difference between path and classpath variables?
Path is an environment variable which is used by the operating system to find the executables. Classpath is an environment variable which is used by the Java compiler to find the path.
What is the difference between an Interface and Abstract class?
Abstract classes can have methods with implementation whereas interface provides absolute abstraction and can't have any method implementations. Abstract classes can have constructors but interfaces can't have constructors.
Can you make an Object from an Interface and Abstract class ? if not how do you use it ?
we cant create object of abstract class. you can implement the Abstract class / interface in a new class
what is Access Specifier?
private, default, protected, public
What is OOP ? Define each feature of java OOP.
abstraction: Abstraction is the concept of hiding the internal details and describing things in simple terms.
 encapsulation: encapsulation is used for access restriction to class members and methods.
  inheritance: an object is based on another object.
  polymorphism: an object behaves differently in different situations.
What is Java Package and which package is imported by default?
What is API? Name list of API that you have used so far.
Does java support multiple inheritance, explain why or why not?
What is method overloading and when it happens?
Explain exceptions in java and how to handle it.
What is static keyword in java? How it has been used in variables and methods ?
What is final and how it has been used variables and methods?
What is final, finally and finalize?
What is a constructor ?
Can we have multiple constructors in a class?
If we don't have a constructor declared, what is called during the object creation?
What is "this" keyword in java ?
What is "super" keyword in java? How many possible way can you use?
What is JVM stand for ?
Is JVM platform independent?

What is Singleton class?
What is Serialization and Deserialization?
when to use transient variable in java?
Difference between while and do..while loop?
What is Enum?
What is Iterator?
Which one will take more memory, an int or Integer?
Why is String Immutable in Java?
What is constructor chaining in Java?
The difference between Serial and Parallel Garbage Collector?
What is JIT stands for?
Explain Java Heap space and Garbage collection?
Can you guarantee the garbage collection process?
What is the difference between stack and heap in Java?
What is reflection in java and why is it useful?
what is multithreading in java?
What is the use of synchronization in Java?
What is Framework?
